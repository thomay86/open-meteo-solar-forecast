## Python API fetching Solarpanels forecast information.

## About

With this python library you can request data from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/)
and see what your solar panels may produce in the coming days.

## Installation

```bash
pip install open-meteo-solar-forecast
```

## Data

This library returns a lot of different data, based on the API:

### Energy

- Total Estimated Energy Production - today/tomorrow (kWh)
- Estimated Energy Production - This Hour (kWh)
- Estimated Energy Production - Next Hour (kWh)
- Estimated Energy Production - Remaining today (kWh)

### Power

- Highest Power Peak Time - Today (datetime)
- Highest Power Peak Time - Tomorrow (datetime)
- Estimated Power Production - Now (W)
- Estimated Power Production - Next Hour (W)
- Estimated Power Production - In +6 Hours (W)
- Estimated Power Production - In +12 Hours (W)
- Estimated Power Production - In +24 Hours (W)

### API Info

- Timezone
- Rate limit
- Account type
- Rate remaining

### Validation

- API key (bool)
- Plane (bool)

## Example

```python
import asyncio

from open_meteo_solar_forecast import OpenMeteoSolarForecast


async def main() -> None:
    """Show example on how to use the library."""
    async with OpenMeteoSolarForecast(
        latitude=52.16,
        longitude=4.47,
        declination=20,
        azimuth=10,
        dc_kwp=2.160,
		use_horizon=True,
        horizon_map=((0,30),(360,30),
    ) as forecast:
        estimate = await forecast.estimate()
        print(estimate)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

| Parameter | value type | Description |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `base_url` | `str` | The base URL of the API (optional) |
| `api_key` | `str` | Your API key (optional) |
| `declination` | `int` | The tilt of the solar panels (required) |
| `azimuth` | `int` | The direction the solar panels are facing (required) |
| `dc_kwp` | `float` | The size of the solar panels in kWp (required) |
| `use_horizon` | `bool` | Whether to use horizon shading (optional, default = False) |
| `horizon_map` | `tuple of 2-tuples` | Map of the horizon* (required if use_horizon = True) |

*) The horizon map is a tuple of 2-tuples, where each 2-tuple consists of (azimuth,elevation). Azimuth is the compass direction in degrees (0° = north, 180° = south). The horizon map has to cover the whole range of azimuths that the sun travels through over the year (recommendation: plot the horizon from 0 to 360°). Elevation is the associated angle in degrees of any object (hill, tree, ...) casting a shadow on the modules. The elevation angle has to be in the range 0° (flat, ideal horizon) to 90° (in the sky directly over the modules). The map has to be monotonic on the azimuth axis, however this is not checked by the script! Elevation values in between are interpolated along the azimuth axis, thus non-monotonic values will give wrong results.

Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:

## Setting up development environment

This Python project relies on [Poetry][poetry] as its dependency manager,
providing comprehensive management and control over project dependencies.

You need at least:

- Python 3.11+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]

Install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
poetry install
```

Poetry creates by default an virtual environment where it installs all
necessary pip packages, to enter or exit the venv run the following commands:

```bash
poetry shell
exit
```
